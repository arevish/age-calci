## Scenario
Take age or year of birth as an input from the user. Store the input in one variable. Your program should detect whether the entered input is AGE or YEAR of birth(DOB) and tell the user when they will turn 100 years old.

## Instructions to follow
Here are a few instructions that you must have to follow:

1. Do not use any type of module like `DateTime` or `Date utils`.
2. Users can optionally provide a year, and your program must tell their age in that particular year.
3.  Your code should handle all sorts of errors like :          
 * You are not yet born
 * You seem to be the oldest person alive
 * You can also handle any other errors, if possible!

## PRE-REQUISITES
Your laptop with 3.6.x (onwards) installed.

**NOTE:** Those with Linux and MacOSX would have Python installed by default, no action required.

Windows: Download the version for your laptop via https://www.python.org/downloads/

**NOTES**
In your preferred editor, make sure indentation is set to "4 spaces".


## Run using Python3.8+
1. Clone or download repositiory: https://github.com/arevish/age-calci.git
